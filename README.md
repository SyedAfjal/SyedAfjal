<!-- Level1: Simple bio and stats -->
# Hi, I'm Syed!
üíª I'm a senior at Stony Brook University studying [Technological Systems Management](https://www.stonybrook.edu/undergraduate-admissions/programs/tsm.php).<br/>
üõ°Ô∏è I am interested in pursuing opportunities within the IT and cybersecurity fields that allow me to leverage my skillset while continuing to grow and advance my expertise. While I am particularly drawn to positions such as security analyst and security engineer, I am open to any role within IT that offers the opportunity to contribute, learn, and push my abilities further in areas such as data analysis, system/network security, and overall IT infrastructure management.<br/>
üîê I'm currently preparing for the CompTIA Security+ certification and gaining hands-on experience by completing cybersecurity labs on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/r/p/SyedAfjal)!<br/>
